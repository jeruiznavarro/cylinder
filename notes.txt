#####PHYSICAL QUESTIONS#####

when the liquid particles go from +z to -z they may get out of the cylinder, be careful with this
when measuring and calculating stuff that depends on N is this variable only the free particles or all of them? it's probably just the free ones
which temperature should be used to calculate Cv? the temporal average of all the simulation as well?
when calculating the pressure and the potential energy by cylinders, should it be counted according to the cylinder in which the particle receiving the interaction (n1) is located at? or should it be only when the interacting couple is in the cylinder?
is the potential energy between two fixed particles relevant?
should the pressure be measured over a certain amount of steps so we can average over them? is the interval between the rest of measurements a good candidate for that amount of steps?
is the density of the free particles the only interesting one?

#####COMPUTATIONAL QUESTIONS#####

is using a module for storing common stuff slower than using common blocks (because it may be an object)?
are internal subroutines better than external ones?
how to get ifort?

#####THINGS TO DO#####

don't forget to finish implementing something to read masses from a file in case they are different or just generating them according to where they are in the lattice
!#####HERE MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE POTENTIAL ENERGY FOR PARTICLES LOCATED EXCLUSIVELY IN EACH CYLINDER
!#####BE CAREFUL, IF THE SIMULATION BOX IS NOT COMPLETELY ON THE NON NEGATIVE PARTS OF THE AXES SEGMENTATION FAULTS MAY APPEAR WHEN CREATING THE CELL LISTS



change kboltz, epsi, fvec becomes avec, intrad, latcon, mass, measintv, radius, sigm, siz, temp, tempbath, time, tmax, tmeas, trelax, tstep, all functions, calculate_some_constants(), create_porous_structure(), half_leap(), interacting(), normal_measuring()? are you sure?, measuring_with_cylinders()? are you sure?

the pressures still need the forces after you get avec
