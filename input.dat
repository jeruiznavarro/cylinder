.false.,#halfdensity				if true, the fluid in the porous system will have half of its particles erased to achieve a half of the previous density

.true.,#noinitialinterac			if false, the initial interactions between all the particles won't be computed
.false.,#periodicspeed				if true, no matter how fast the particles move, the periodic boundary conditions will apply, but this might make some bugs much harder to detect (and uses a tiny bit more resources)
20,#pores							amount of pores in the system
2.5d-1,#radius						radius of the non solid zone of the system where particles can flow
.true.,#removedrift					if true, the average momentum of the system will be eliminated so there is no global drift
