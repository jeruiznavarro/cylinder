# cylinder

To compile just type ./compile.sh in the terminal after selecting debug or release options by commenting or uncommenting the appropiate line in the file
If the gnuplot variable is .true., you can view the particles in 3d during runtime by launching the program as ./cylinder_system.exe | gnuplot (you obviously need gnuplot in your machine to use this)
The dranxor2.f95 is an old but quite good pseudo-random number generator, I will try to update and make the code more readable eventually
This is a work in progress, things may blow up for no apparent reason
