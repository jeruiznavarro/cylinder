when the liquid particles go from +z to -z they may get out of the cylinder, be careful with this
when measuring and calculating stuff that depends on N is this variable only the free particles or all of them? it's probably just the free ones
which temperature should be used to calculate Cv? the temporal average of all the simulation as well?
which values should the speeds of the particles have? SOLVED: boltzman with mean 0 and for the sd look at the project description of FYS4460
when calculating the pressure and the potential energy by cylinders, should it be counted according to the cylinder in which the particle receiving the interaction (n1) is located at? or should it be only when the interacting couple is in the cyli
is the potential energy between two fixed particles relevant?
